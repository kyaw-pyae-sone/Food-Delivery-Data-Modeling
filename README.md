# Food Delivery Data Modeling | SDLC & Requirement Engineering

> **Note to Recruiters:** This repository showcases my proficiency in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Requirements Engineering. While the primary case study documented here is an **Online Bus Ticket Management System**, the architectural patterns—specifically the **Real-time Inventory Selection**, **Scheduling Logic**, and **Transaction Workflows**—serve as the foundational model for the **Food Delivery System** architecture referenced in my professional profile.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a deep-dive into the **Requirement Engineering** and **Design Modeling** phases of the SDLC. It demonstrates how to translate complex business needs into a structured, technical blueprint.

### Why this architecture applies to Food Delivery:

The logic used in this "Bus Ticket" system is a direct architectural parallel to a "Food Delivery" system:

* **Inventory Mapping:** Reserving a "Specific Seat" uses the same logic as reserving "Restaurant Inventory."
* **Scheduling:** Managing "Bus Departures" is identical to managing "Delivery Windows."
* **User Roles:** The interaction between Passengers (Customers), Admins (Operations), and Drivers (Delivery Partners) follows the same behavioral sequences.

## 🛠️ SDLC & Engineering Methodology

### 1. Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

Detailed documentation following **IEEE Standards**, covering:

* **Functional Requirements:** Resource browsing, real-time availability checking, and booking confirmation.
* **Non-functional Requirements:** Scalability, sub-second latency for inventory locks, and high-availability design.

### 2. Behavioral Modeling (Sequence Diagrams)

Dynamic system modeling that illustrates how data flows between the User, Web Server, and Database:

* **Resource Allocation:** Logic for selecting and locking specific inventory items.
* **Transaction Processing:** Secure modeling of third-party payment gateway integration.
* **Management Workflows:** Administrative control over routes, schedules, and service availability.

## 🎓 Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my ability to handle the **Requirement Analysis** and **Design** stages of the SDLC. By mastering these architectural patterns, I am prepared to design and scale complex systems in the Food Delivery, Logistics, and Fintech industries.
